## Additional Material

In 2022 the 2nd edition of my book ([Applied Deep Learning, a use-case based approach](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484237892)) will come out. During 2021 the web companion will grow and contains a lot of material that you can consult. You can find it at [https://adl.toelt.ai](https://adl.toelt.ai).
