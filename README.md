# DSC-Intro-TensorFlow
This repository contains the hands-on notebooks for the DSC Introduction to TensorFlow (ETH).

## Contact

In case you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time at [umberto.michelucci@toelt.ai](mailto:umberto.michelucci@toelt.ai).

## Technical Prerequisites

To try the following notebooks you will not need to install anything. Clicking on the links will open them in Google Colab, so that you can try the code immediately.

## Slides

All the slides are in google slides. So a browser is all you need to check them out.

## Additional Material

In 2022 the 2nd edition of my book ([Applied Deep Learning, a use-case based approach](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484237892)) will come out. During 2021 the web companion will grow and contains a lot of material that you can consult. You can find it at [https://adl.toelt.ai](https://adl.toelt.ai).
